## Overview
<p>This project is a security and rest API focus project. It's a very good practice thinking about webapp security while writing every line of code, especially when I'm working in a company that puts security in the first place. This project includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Different protected routes to create users</li>
  <li>Express routers and Postman to monitor API calls, and verify if an user is authenticated while logging in.</li>
</ul>
